College News

1. A website to post news related to college activities.
2. Frontend created using React JS.
3. Backend API setup using Node JS, Express, MongoDB.
4. Deployment -> https://college-news.netlify.app/
5. User flow: register/login -> add/view news.
6. User cannot view/add news items without logging in. 

Things I am still working on
1. Ensuring user does not register with fake email. I am planning to implement sending verification code to user's email.
2. Filter news items based on three categories: sports, cultural, academics.
3. Some bugs, minor details like redirecting to correct path, etc.
4. Showing confirmation messages on user registration, editing news items, etc.
